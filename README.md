# IT 420 - Red Team Strategies Lab
Ensign College - Winter Semester 2024

Students will work in teams to research attack paths that adversaries use today against corporate networks.  Teams will use a basic network to learn about red-teaming and associated tools; using these tools, students will emulate the adversaries based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
